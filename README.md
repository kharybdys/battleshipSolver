This project encapsulates a solver for the battleships logic game (eg [brainbashers](https://www.brainbashers.com/battleships.asp)).
It mimics human logic as it's intended as a tool to check whether randomly generated puzzles have a unique, findable, solution.
And for myself to find more advanced logic steps if the solver doesn't manage to complete a puzzle.

Currently the only way to use it is to prepare a json describing the initial situation, combined with using one of the defined sizes from sizes.py.

## TODO

I intend to write a random generator for puzzles but haven't gotten to that point yet
